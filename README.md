# üëã About Me

Hey there! I'm Arch, and I'm a developer with a passion for creating innovative tools and frameworks.
By profession, I work as a React developer, but my true passion lies in crafting frameworks and tools right here on GitHub.

Some of my notable side projects include:

- [discord-player](https://discord-player.js.org): A robust framework for building Discord music bots.
- [canvacord](https://canvacord.js.org): A creative framework centered around the concept of image manipulation.
- [mediaplex](https://github.com/androzdev/mediaplex): A simple media transcoding utility for Node.js.
- [youtube-sr](https://github.com/twlite/youtube-sr): A dead-simple YouTube metadata scraper.

And there's more where that came from!
