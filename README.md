# 💫 About Me:

As a student, I tend to keep to myself and enjoy quieter activities. One of my favorite hobbies is coding, which I like to do in my free time. It allows me to exercise my creativity and problem-solving skills while also providing a nice break from my regular lifestyle. Oh, and you can call me `Arch` while communicating.

Usually some TypeScript and other stuff (it depends, as I identify as a `Pull Stack Developer`).
